# GBEmu
(Because coming up with proper names is difficult)

GBEmu depends on Qt5, SDL2 and OpenGL. To compile, run <code>qmake</code> then <code>make</code>.

Key features currently are:
* DMG/GBC boot ROM integration (allows classic Gameboy games to run with proper GBC palettes)
* Gameboy Printer support

Planned features that haven't been implemented yet:
* Serial connection through network sockets
* Rewinding
